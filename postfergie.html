 <h3>Hand picked by Sir Alex | David Moyes 2013 - 2014</h3> <img src ="moyes pic.jpg" alt="David Moyes stressed as Utd Manager">

<h4> Moyes signed a six-year contract with Manchester United, and officially took up his managerial position on 1 July 2013. Moyes had been hand-picked as manager by Sir Alex Ferguson and after his appointment a banner reading "The Chosen One" was displayed at Old Trafford. On 11 August 2013, he won his only trophy with Manchester United in his first official game, a 2–0 win over Wigan Athletic in the FA Community Shield. It meant he became the first United manager in history to win a trophy outright in his first season in charge. Less than a week later, he won his first league game in charge of the club, opening the season with a 4–1 victory against Swansea City, but after that, United suffered their worst ever start to a Premier League season with several journalists stating the pressure was now on despite it being early in his reign</h4>

    <h4>In December, Manchester United lost Premier League matches at home to Everton and Newcastle United in the space of four days suffering back-to-back league defeats at Old Trafford for the first time since the 2001–02 season. United were ninth in the table after 15 games, 13 points behind leaders Arsenal. Moyes said that he took "complete responsibility" for United's defeats but said he was confident his team would improve. Moyes did however have a positive start to his first Champions League campaign with the club. United finished top of their group after winning four of their six group stage matches.
    In January 2014, United were knocked out of the FA Cup in the third round by Swansea City, losing 2–1 at home and lost in the semi-final of the Football League Cup, with Sunderland winning a penalty shoot-out. In February, United lost 2–1 at Stoke. Following consecutive 0–3 home defeats against Liverpool and Manchester City, a flypast was staged by United fans with the banner displaying "Wrong One – Moyes Out" in seven-foot-high lettering during a home match against Aston Villa in March. On 20 April 2014, United lost 2–0 at Everton. Two days later, United announced that they had sacked Moyes. Moyes oversaw United for 10 months, the third-shortest managerial stint in United history.</h4>

    <h3>Louis Van Gaal 2014 - 2016</h3> <img src ="lvgmanu.jpg" alt="Louis Van Gaal as United Manager">
    <h4>Netherland’s manager Louis van Gaal was appointed as Moyes' permanent replacement on 19 May 2014, taking charge after the end of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In his inaugural season, United signed many prominent players and returned to the Champions League with a 4th-place finish. In his second season, United finished in 5th place behind Manchester City, out of Champions League position, but won the 2016 FA Cup, the club's first in a dozen years. The board, however, decided that not enough progress had been made from the previous season and Van Gaal was sacked on 23 May 2016, just days after lifting the cup.</h4>

     <h3> The Special One| Jose Mourinho 2016 - 2018</h3> <img src ="josemanu.jpg" alt="Jose Mourinho as United manager">
    <h4>LVG was replaced by two-time European champion and former Chelsea boss José Mourinho (the special one) on 27 May 2016. Mourinho became United's fourth manager (including Giggs) in as many years since Ferguson's retirement. He won the EFL Cup and UEFA Europa League in his first season but failed to win any silverware in 2017–18 and was sacked on 18 December 2018 after the team won just seven of their opening 17 matches of the 2018–19 season.</h4>

    <h4>Ole Gunnar Solskjær was appointed as caretaker manager for the rest of the season. On 19 January 2019, Solskjær won his seventh out of seven games in charge of United, a new club record, and on 28 March 2019, following victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League, Solskjær was given the job permanently. On 21 November 2021, Solskjær left his post as the first full-time manager since Frank O'Farrell to not win a trophy for United and was replaced by first-team coach Michael Carrick on caretaking basis.</h4>
