    <h2 class="title">PRE AND DURING SIR ALEX FERGUSON'S SUCCESSFUL REIGN</h2>
   
<h4>Ferguson was appointed manager of Manchester United in November 1986. During his 26 years with Manchester United he won 38 trophies, including 13 Premier League titles, five FA Cups, and two UEFA Champions League titles. He was knighted in the 1999 Queen's Birthday Honours list for his services to the game. Ferguson is the longest-serving manager of Manchester United, having overtaken Sir Matt Busby's record on 19 December 2010. He retired from management at the end of the 2012–13 season, having won the Premier League in his final season. He is still the most successful manager to date<h4>

<H2>WHO IS FERGIE?</H2>

<h4> Alex Ferguson, in full Sir Alexander Chapman Ferguson, byname Fergie, (born December 31, 1941, Glasgow, Scotland), Scottish Football player and manager who was best known for managing Manchester United (1986–2013). Ferguson was the longest-tenured manager in Manchester United history and led the club to more than 30 domestic and international titles, including 13 Premier League championships, five FA Cup wins and two Champions League titles.</h4>
<h4>At age 16 Ferguson joined the Scottish second-division football club Queen’s Park, playing as an amateur while also working in a Glasgow shipyard. His professional football career began in 1964, when he signed with first-division Dunfermline Athletic. Ferguson tied for the league lead in scoring by tallying 31 goals during the 1965–66 Scottish League season, and in 1967 he was transferred to his hometown Rangers for a then-record £65,000 fee. He was a solid if unspectacular player in two seasons with the Rangers and played for two other clubs before retiring in 1974.</h4>
 
<h2> DID YOU KNOW?</h2>
 
 <h4>Under Ferguson’s guidance, Aberdeen experienced the greatest period of success in club history, winning three Scottish Premier Division titles, four Scottish, and a European Cup Winners’ Cup.</H4>
 <h4>Man U was initially inconsistent under Ferguson’s guidance, finishing in 11th, 2nd, 11th, and 13th place in the first division of the Football League during his first four seasons with the club. He was widely reported to have been in danger of losing his job before Manchester salvaged the 1989–90 season by winning the FA Cup</H4>

 <h2> THE HEIGHT OF MANAGERIAL SUCCESS</h2>
 
<h4>The 1989-1990 FA Cup win marked the beginning of the most successful managerial run in English football history, as Man U won eight Premier League championships in the 11 seasons from 1992–93 to 2002–03, capturing three FA Cup titles as well. The highlight of this period came during the 1998–99 season, when—in addition to taking that season’s league championship and FA Cup—Manchester won the Champions League title to earn the first “treble in English football history. After going three years without a league championship, United won five Premier League titles in a seven-season span from 2006–07 to 2012–13, with a second Champions League win in 2008. Ferguson retired at the end of the 2012–13 Premier League season but stayed on with Man U in a front-office role and as a club ambassador.</h4>
